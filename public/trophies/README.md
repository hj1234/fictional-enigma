# Trophy Images

This folder contains trophy images for the game awards.

## Current Files

The following SVG files are provided as placeholders:
- `hedge_fund_of_month.svg` - Hedge Fund of the Month award
- `cash_millionaire.svg` - Cash Millionaire award
- `nav_200m.svg` - Elite Fund award
- `ltcm_trophy.svg` - LTCM Trophy award

## Replacing with PNGs

To use your own PNG designs:

1. Convert or replace the SVG files with PNG images
2. Name them exactly as follows:
   - `hedge_fund_of_month.png`
   - `cash_millionaire.png`
   - `nav_200m.png`
   - `ltcm_trophy.png`

3. Recommended size: 200x200 pixels (or higher resolution for retina displays)

The code will automatically use PNG files if they exist, and fall back to SVG if PNGs are not found.
